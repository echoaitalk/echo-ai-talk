#### Abstract

OSWorld is a novel, scalable environmentdesigned to evaluate autonomous digital agents across diverse real-worldcomputer tasks. Supporting multiple operating systems like Ubuntu, Windows, andmacOS, OSWorld enables comprehensive, execution-based evaluations of agents ininteractive settings involving web and desktop applications. Our benchmarkincludes 369 tasks derived from actual use cases, highlighting the currentlimitations of state-of-the-art agents, which achieve only a 12.24% successrate compared to humans' 72.36%. This platform provides crucial insights foradvancing multimodal agent development. Resources are publicly available toencourage further exploration in this promising field.
