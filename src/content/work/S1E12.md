#### Abstract

Originating from natural language processing, the new paradigm of prompting has recently swept through the computer vision community, which brought disruptive changes to a wide spectrum of domains such as image classification and image generation. In comparison to the traditional fixed-once-learned architecture, like a linear classifier trained to recognize a specific set of categories, prompting offers greater flexibility and more opportunities for novel applications. This is because prompting allows the model to perform new tasks, such as recognizing unseen categories, by tuning textual instructions or modifying a small number of parameters in the model's input space while keeping most of the pre-trained parameters untouched. This paradigm significantly pushes human-AI interaction to unprecedented levels. This talk will discuss how to prompt vision foundation models like vision-language models for generic visual perception tasks, e.g., classification and detection.
