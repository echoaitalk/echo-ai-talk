#### Abstract

Collective intelligence underpins the success of groups, organizations, markets and societies. Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities. Often, collective intelligence is supported by information technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge from the public. Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.

#### Speaker

Jason Burton is an Assistant Professor at Copenhagen Business School and an Associate Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. His research examines the computational mechanisms of human reasoning, how digital technologies affect those mechanisms, and how information environments can be designed to promote collective intelligence. He holds a PhD in Psychology from Birkbeck, University of London, and an MSc in Organizational Psychiatry & Psychology from King’s College London.
